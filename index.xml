      <description>And more importantly, answering my first (and probably last) stack overflow question. I had a bunch of videos (300+) and I needed to change the ratio to 9:16, so I could upload them as youtube shorts. No problem I thought, trusty google will solve my problem. Boom. First result is the exact question I&amp;rsquo;m asking for.
Damn. No answers. We&amp;rsquo;re going to have to tackle this on our own.
We are going to be using python&amp;rsquo;s library Moviepy to solve our problem.</description>
